# Enslavism

A framework to deploy authoritative WebRTC game servers with a master.
It will be used by [JumpSuit](https://github.com/KordonBleu/jumpsuit).
The goal is to implement a framework to deal with a master server architecture such as JumpSuit's, but with WebRTC's DataChannels instead of WebSockets. It is also to make it reusable.
Very WIP. Probably a lot of code will come from JumpSuit.
